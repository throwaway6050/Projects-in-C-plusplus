### Projects-in-C-plusplus

C++ Projects I thought would help me get hired somewhere at some point. I'm really just seeing what I can accomplish, show some notes, and hopefully get into offensive cyber security in the future. 

I have a background in Systems Engineering, Systems Administration, Test/Integration Engineering, Cloud Engineering, Network Engineering, Signal Analysis/Collection, and SATCOM Operations.

I joined the Army (active duty component) in 2014, was honorably discharged in 2018. I ended up becoming a federal contractor as I saw IT was the future and I really wanted to hit the ground running. In 2019 I rejoined the military (reserve component). I'm taking some time off from the military to focus on college, certifications, and learning how to code. I'm only 30 years old, so I figured I'd finally start working with code as it's something I haven't had a chance to work with. 

I hope this stupid auto biography gives you enough background information about me where you can see/understand why I do the projects that I do.
